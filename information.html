    The popularity of pizza in the United States began with the Italian
    community in New York City, where the Neapolitan pizza had an early
    influence. The first pizzeria appeared in New York City about the turn of
    the 20th century. After World War II the pizza industry boomed. Soon there
    was scarcely a hamlet without a pizzeria. Sausage, bacon, ground beef,
    pepperoni, mushrooms, and peppers are traditional toppings familiar to many
    Americans, but ingredients as varied as arugula, pancetta, and truffles have
    found their way onto pizzas there. Variations are also often tied to
    different regions in the country, Chicago’s deep-dish pizza and
    California-style pizza among them.

    > Baking In restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with fire bricks
    above the heat source, an electric deck oven, a conveyor belt oven, or, in
    traditional style in a wood or coal-fired brick oven. The pizza is slid into
    the oven on a long paddle, called a peel, and baked directly on hot bricks,
    a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum), or whatever the oven
    surface is. Before use, a peel is typically sprinkled with cornmeal to allow
    the pizza to easily slide on and off it.[37] When made at home, a pizza can
    be baked on a pizza stone in a regular oven to reproduce some of the heating
    effect of a brick oven. Cooking directly on a metal surface results in too
    rapid heat transfer to the crust, burning it.[38] Some home chefs use a
    wood-fired pizza oven, usually installed outdoors. As in restaurants, these
    are often dome-shaped, as pizza ovens have been for centuries,[39] in order
    to achieve even heat distribution. Another variation is grilled pizza, in
    which the pizza is baked directly on a barbecue grill. Greek pizza, like
    deep dish Chicago and Sicilian style pizza, is baked in a pan rather than
    directly on the bricks of the pizza oven. Most restaurants use standard and
    purpose-built pizza preparation tables to assemble their pizzas. Mass
    production of pizza by chains can be completely automated.

    Crust Carmelized crust – its cornicione (the outer edge) – of slices of New
    York-style pizza The bottom of the pizza, called the "crust", may vary
    widely according to style – thin as in a typical hand-tossed Neapolitan
    pizza or thick as in a deep-dish Chicago-style. It is traditionally plain,
    but may also be seasoned with garlic or herbs, or stuffed with cheese. The
    outer edge of the pizza is sometimes referred to as the cornicione.[40] Some
    pizza dough contains sugar, to help its yeast rise and enhance browning of
    the crust.[41]
    <br />
    Dipping sauce specifically for pizza was invented by American pizza chain
    Papa John's Pizza in 1984 and has since been adopted by some when eating
    pizza, especially the crust.[42]

    Cheese Main article: Pizza cheese
    <br />
    A pizza quattro formaggi (Italian: [ˈkwattro forˈmaddʒi], "four cheeses") in
    London Mozzarella cheese is commonly used on pizza, with the buffalo
    mozzarella produced in the surroundings of Naples.[43] Other cheeses are
    also used, particularly Italian cheeses including provolone, pecorino
    romano, ricotta, and scamorza. Less expensive processed cheeses or cheese
    analogues have been developed for mass-market pizzas to produce desirable
    qualities like browning, melting, stretchiness, consistent fat and moisture
    content, and stable shelf life. This quest to create the ideal and
    economical pizza cheese has involved many studies and experiments analyzing
    the impact of vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, denatured
    whey proteins, and other changes in manufacture. In 1997, it was estimated
    that annual production of pizza cheese was 1 million metric tons (1,100,000
    short tons) in the U.S. and 100,000 metric tons (110,000 short tons) in
    Europe.[44]

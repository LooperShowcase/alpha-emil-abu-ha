          Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian
          origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened
          wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various
          other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives,
          pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature,
          traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes
          called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
          In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is
          eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual settings,
          however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand. The
          term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin
          manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the
          border with Campania.[4] Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the
          dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries.[5]
          It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common
          fast food item in Europe, North America and Australasia; available at
          pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering
          Mediterranean cuisine, via pizza delivery, and as street food.[5]
          Various food companies sell ready-baked pizzas, which may be frozen,
          in grocery stores, to be reheated in a home oven. In 2017, the world
          pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion
          spread over 76,000 pizzerias.[6] Overall, 13% of the U.S. population
          aged 2 years and over consumed pizza on any given day.[7] The
          Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit. True Neapolitan Pizza
          Association) is a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with
          headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan
          pizza.[8] In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was
          registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality
          Guaranteed dish,[9][10] and in 2017 the art of its making was included
          on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.[11] Raffaele
          Esposito is often considered to be the father of modern
          pizza.[12][13][14][15]
